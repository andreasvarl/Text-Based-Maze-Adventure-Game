# 🧩 Text-Based Maze Adventure Game

Welcome to the **Maze Adventure Game** – a simple, interactive, text-based game written in JavaScript using the `prompt-sync` module. This project is a fun way to learn and practice basic programming concepts like conditionals, user input, and flow control.

## 🎮 Gameplay

The game begins by asking for your name and whether you want to play. If you say "yes", you’ll enter a mysterious maze and must make decisions that determine your fate:

- Will you go **left** or **right**?
- Will you **cross the bridge** or not?
- Each decision leads to a different outcome!

## 🛠️ Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system
- The `prompt-sync` module for user input in the terminal
